Description: Collapses fasta sequences into consensus sequences based on criteria set by user. 

For example, if the metadata file contains field lineage, the user can split the main fasta file 
into individual fasta files with all sequences of that lineage. The program will then create an 
alignment of that group of which a consensus will be built upon. The output file will consist of 
a single consensus file with all consensus sequences for each group divided by the trait. If a 
clade file is given (only work for lineages), the grouping will be collapse to the closest lineage 
(i.e. 1.1.2.1 collapsed to 1.1.2). The Log file will flag all sequences with no trait value and 
sequences that does not have a match between fasta and metadata files.

    Collapses sequences into consensus sequences based on grouping by index column or index field

    metadata that the user wants to split the fasta file by for consensus to be created. Metadata file must be in .csv
