Description: Split the fasta file into multiple fasta files based on criteria set by user.

For example, if the metadata file contains field country, the user can split the main fasta
file into individual fasta files with all sequences of that country. Log file will flag all
sequences with no trait value and sequences that does not have a match between fasta and
metadata files.

Options:
    --lineage: Allow user to specify specific lineages to split by. The lineage list does not need to consist of all the lineage present. All sub-lineages will collapse to the closes lineage (e.g. 1.1.1 collapse to 1.1)
